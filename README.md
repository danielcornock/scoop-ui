## Issues

When the order of fields is changed via settings for net worth, the label become mismatched on the net worth log table. AFAIK no data is corrupted but data is just mis-labelled.

##Â TODO
Refactor graph components to take in more streamlined version of the data.
Restrict user from adding entries for future dates
